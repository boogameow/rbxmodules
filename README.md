# Roblox Modules
This github hosts the various modules I make, each with a different purpose.
Generally should be drop in to any game, with some reading of the methods.

## PartnerService
Global matchmaking for "story intersections", using a combination of MemoryStores and Messaging.

## Preload
Module used to preload sounds and images. PreloadAsync did not work for me, so I custom made one.
